# GitHub Pages Starter (Header Video)

This is a minimal one-page site that shows a full-screen header video.

## How to use

1. Put your video file in the repository root and name it `video.mp4` (or change the `src` path in `index.html`).
2. Commit and push to your repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Settings → Pages → Set "Deploy from a branch", branch: `main`, folder: `/` → Save.
4. (Optional) Add a custom domain in Settings → Pages → Custom domain.

### Tips
- Keep the video small (< 25 MB recommended). Use H.264/AAC MP4 for best compatibility.
- Mobile autoplay requires the video to be **muted** and `playsinline`.
- If you use `www.yourdomain.com`, create a `CNAME` record at your DNS pointing to `yourusername.github.io`.
